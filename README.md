### Personal Page

This project was made using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

I was interested in learning these cool technologies and I thought what better way to explore them than to create a web app. Developing with these tools was a breeze and a blast - after all, learning should be fun!
